#BudgetBar

Budget Bar was inspired by my favorite time tracking application called [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com)

I've been working on a few laps latley that required a budget health visualization and a single bar graph is a great way to do that.

###Usage

I've added an HTML Helper for MVC3 apps that make it super simple to add a bar:
    @Html.BudgetBar(50, 100)

The MVC app is ready to go. Just fork it and run it for examples.

I plan on adding more helpers in other languages such as Ruby and PHP to stay tuned. If you'd like to jump in and help, please feel free.
